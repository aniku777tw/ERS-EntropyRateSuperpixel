# ERS-EntropyRateSuperpixel
great work form :  
https://github.com/mingyuliutw/EntropyRateSuperpixel  
and  
https://github.com/wctu/SEAL  

If you got the error about "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.".  
Then you are at the right place. :)  
The reason is the python version!    
# info  
make it can be use in Python3  
go to folder ERSPython  
run  
python compile_cpp.py build  
and then you can get the .pyd   


Have fun !
